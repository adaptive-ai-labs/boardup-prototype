# BoardUp Application Architecture

## Overview

BoardUp is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript, designed for architectural exam preparation. The application follows a component-based architecture with a custom routing system and local state management.

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Component-Based Architecture
- **Atomic Design Principles**: Components are organized by complexity and reusability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Components are composed together to build complex UIs

### 2. State Management Strategy
Currently using React's built-in state management:
- **Local State**: `useState` for component-specific state
- **Prop Drilling**: Data passed through component hierarchy
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable state logic (planned for future)

**Future Considerations**:
- Redux Toolkit for complex global state
- Context API for user authentication state
- React Query for server state management

```

## Routing Strategy

### Custom Page-Based Routing
The application uses a custom routing system implemented in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
type PageType = 'home' | 'register' | 'setup' | 'dashboard' | 'contact';
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState<PageType>('home');
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple implementation for current needs
- No external dependencies
- Easy to understand and debug

**Limitations**:
- No URL-based navigation
- No browser history support
- No deep linking capability

**Future Migration Path**:
- Migrate to React Router for proper routing
- Add URL-based navigation
- Implement protected routes for authenticated users

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Props Down, Events Up
- Data flows down through props
- User interactions bubble up through callback functions
- State is managed at the appropriate component level

### 2. State Lifting
- Shared state is lifted to the nearest common ancestor
- Example: Quiz progress state managed in parent component

### 3. Event Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Parent component provides handlers
const handleSomeEvent = (data: SomeType) => {
  // Process data and update state
};

// Child component receives and calls handlers
<ChildComponent onSomeEvent={handleSomeEvent} />
```

## Component Categories

### 1. Page Components (Smart Components)
- Manage application state
- Handle business logic
- Coordinate child components
- Examples: `AccountLandingPage`, `QuizLandingPage`

### 2. Feature Components
- Implement specific features
- Manage local state
- Handle user interactions
- Examples: `FlashcardStudyPage`, `PracticeQuizPage`

### 3. UI Components (Dumb Components)
- Pure presentation logic
- Receive data via props
- Minimal or no state
- Examples: `Logo`, `Header`, `Footer`

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. TypeScript Integration
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface-based component props
- Type-safe event handlers
- Future-proof for scaling

### 2. Tailwind CSS for Styling
- Utility-first approach
- Consistent design system
- Responsive design built-in
- No CSS-in-JS complexity

### 3. Lucide React for Icons
- Consistent icon system
- Tree-shakeable imports
- TypeScript support
- Customizable styling

### 4. Sound and Voice Integration
- Web Audio API for sound effects
- Speech Recognition API for voice commands
- Progressive enhancement (graceful degradation)

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Bundle Optimization
- Vite for fast builds and HMR
- Tree-shaking for unused code elimination
- Code splitting opportunities (planned)

### 2. Rendering Optimization
- Proper key props for list items
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Event handler optimization with useCallback (planned)

### 3. Asset Management
- Lazy loading for images (to be implemented)
- Optimized icon usage
- Efficient font loading

## Security Considerations

### Current State (Client-Side Only)
- No authentication system
- No sensitive data storage
- Public client-side code

### Future Security Measures
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure API communication (HTTPS)
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Secure storage for user data

## Error Handling Strategy

### Current Implementation
- Basic try-catch blocks where needed
- Form validation with user feedback
- Graceful degradation for browser APIs

### Future Improvements
- Global error boundary components
- Structured error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery mechanisms

## Testing Strategy (Planned)

### Unit Testing
- React Testing Library for components
- Jest for utility functions
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end user flows
- Component interaction testing
- API integration testing

### Performance Testing
- Bundle size monitoring
- Runtime performance profiling
- Accessibility auditing

## Scalability Considerations

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure (future)
- Shared component library
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### State Management Evolution
```
Current: Local State + Props
↓
Phase 1: Context API for auth
↓
Phase 2: Redux Toolkit for complex state
↓
Phase 3: Server state with React Query
```

### API Integration Strategy
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL consideration for complex queries
- Real-time updates with WebSockets (future)

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced features with modern browser APIs
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Development Workflow

### Build Process
1. TypeScript compilation
2. ESLint code quality checks
3. Vite bundling and optimization
4. Asset processing and optimization

### Code Quality Tools
- ESLint for code consistency
- TypeScript for type safety
- Prettier for code formatting (to be added)
- Husky for git hooks (to be added)

## Future Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Micro-Frontend Architecture
- Split into smaller, deployable units
- Independent team development
- Technology diversity support

### 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Next.js migration consideration
- Improved SEO and performance
- Better initial load times

### 3. Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications
- App-like experience

### 4. Real-Time Features
- Live collaboration on quizzes
- Real-time progress tracking
- Instant messaging for study groups
